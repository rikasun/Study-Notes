- What is a base case in recursion? Why do we need one? _Do_ we always need one?

In recursive program, the solution to base case is provided and solution of bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

- What exactly is a Stack Overflow?

If base case is not reached or not defined, then stack overflow problem may arise.
